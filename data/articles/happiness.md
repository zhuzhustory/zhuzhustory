It finally comes the Mid-Autumn Festival.

Zhuzhu was invited by taromaru to do homework in taromaru's home. They shared their experience about their new senior high school. They ate lunch together and did homework together. Zhuzhu's mood became better because of taromaru's company. And he did not feel sad anymore. 

And this is the last day they have spent together.

However, a message zhuzhu has sent was seen by taromaru's mother. It's a message about the computer games. Taromaru's mother thought that it is zhuzhu to lead taromaru into the computer games so that the worst thing has happened.
