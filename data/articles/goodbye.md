Finally, the senior high school enterance examnation came.

When zhuzhu and taromaru looked up their scores. Taromaru was surprised about his score - 672. He never imagined that he can get such a great score like this. After he visited Yinzhou Senior High School, he signed up for it instead of NBFLS although NBFLS is in the same level with YZSHS. Or he thought about NBFLS's distance is longer than YZSHS.

Before he signed up for YZSHS, zhuzhu is locked by NBFLS Qiangji Class because he signed up for it in June 21st,2022. The reason is he thought his score is not good so he wanted to use the Qiangji Class in guarantee. Although his score is 665, which can sign up for YZSHS. But he did not have any chance to change it.

So it is the time for goodbye. They went different school in senior high and can not meet each other as often as possible in junior high.
