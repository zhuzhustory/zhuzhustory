And the telephone call is more frequently than before. He was insulted by his parents like 'You can enter ZJU depend on this grade?' 'I saw that you spent all time on messing around in computer, no wonder you did so poorly.' 'You just play instead of study at school, right?' 'You haven't put any energy into the study and put full of the energy into the program, right? What is your main business? It is learning!' etc. So he did not want to stay at home anymore.
