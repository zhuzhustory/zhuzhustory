The nightmare finally cames. It started in his last 3 months in junior high after he signed up for NBFLS Qiangji Class. And this changed his personality very much.

It starts with something called 'MHH'.

MHH is a teacher who worked in zhuzhu's teacher's office, who is a dean. At that time,zhuzhu was very enthusiasm for science. So he went to teacher's office to ask his science teacher some problems every after-class time. And a day he entered the teacher's office as usual, MHH got annoyed and he insulted zhuzhu and warned him NOT TO ENTER THE TEACHER'S OFFICE AGAIN. Zhuzhu ran away from teachers' office with tears on his face in frighten. AND NO ONE CARES ABOUT THIS THING AND THEY LAUGHED AT AND PLAYED JOKES ON ZHUZHU WHEN ZHUZHU WAS CRYING. But only taromaru comforts zhuzhu while others are playing jokes on or laughing at this. So it was taromaru to keep company with zhuzhu at that time. Zhuzhu is very grateful for this now.

And then zhuzhu and taromaru spent times on the PE class every two weeks. Taromaru spent his whole time to keep company with zhuzhu in walking around the playground. They exchanged their top secrets because they trust each other and zhuzhu is very surprised by taromaru's story. They had a goal for senior high school - Ningbo Foreign Language School,which zhuzhu is in alone now.
