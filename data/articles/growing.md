Then came the Grade 8. Zhuzhu and taromaru visited each other at their home from time to time. Zhuzhu is positive about this. So it is the most for zhuzhu to invite taromaru.

Zhuzhu and taromaru touched a game called Arknignts and they played it together. Also, they are playing Minecraft but the time is less than before.

Zhuzhu set up a group about arknignts and genshin impact soon because the bad environment in Bilibili because of Chen Rui. Zhuzhu quit bilibili and stopped posting his videos in bilibili in July,2020. And as zhuzhu expected, bilibili is woser than before for ACGN core group. So he watched episodes in Sakura Comic instead of bilibili.

The group is alive now. And zhuzhu quit it because some people will insult him when he expressed his mood and depression episoded in this group. Or it is not a insult,but zhuzhu is so sensitive that he did not want to hear this.

They will say something like: Pure passerby, is this xql?(纯路人，这是xql吗？ in chinese)

About something called 'xql', it is a word that unique to chinese-internet. You can look up it in a chinese search engine. 

Their friendship became grater and zhuzhu thought taromaru is his best friend than ever because zhuzhu thought he only had two friends in his junior high and they grew friendships and spent times more than the other friend.

Then in the first 3 months of Grade 9, although there is a senior high school enterance examation ahead, zhuzhu is not afraid about it because he have taromaru to talk.
